As a Business Data Analyst at CBR, I have undertaken a multifaceted role involving data analysis, dashboard development, and collaboration with the VP of Operations. I played a pivotal role in the implementation of the Control Awareness Reporting Engine (CARE), a real-time performance tracking system aimed at enhancing production oversight.

One of my key achievements has been the generation of sales projections and forecasts, providing valuable insights into future sales trends. Notably, I highlighted Vancouver's dominance with 30.9% of customer purchases, a crucial factor in market analysis. Additionally, I introduced live tracking of operating expenses (OPEX) metrics, identifying Vancouver as the highest contributor at 31.17% and recognizing Calgary's $5.65K shipping costs.

Overall, I've contributed to data-driven decision-making processes, ensuring the company's market dominance and operational efficiency.
